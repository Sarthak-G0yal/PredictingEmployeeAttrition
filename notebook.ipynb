    "From your table, here are my thoughts on the model performances:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Best Performing Model (Overall)**\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** has the highest accuracy (**0.826531**) and the best precision, recall, and F1-score for class `0`.\n",
    "- However, its precision and recall for class `1` are **not significantly better** than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Trade-Offs Between Models**\n",
    "- **Random Forest and SVM** also perform well, with accuracy around **81.9% and 81.6%**, respectively.\n",
    "- **CatBoost** has **balanced recall and precision**, making it slightly better at handling class `1` than LightGBM.\n",
    "- **Decision Tree** has the worst accuracy (**69.04%**), which is expected since it's a single-tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Performance on Minority Class (`1`)**\n",
    "- Precision for class `1` is generally low across all models, ranging between **0.21 to 0.46**, meaning models struggle with false positives.\n",
    "- Recall for class `1` varies, with **Logistic Regression having the highest (0.595745)**.\n",
    "- **F1-score for class `1` is lowest for Decision Tree (0.272),** reinforcing that it's not ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Standard Deviation & Consistency**\n",
    "- **Low standard deviation** in `0_precision`, `0_recall`, and `accuracy` suggests that all models perform consistently on the majority class.\n",
    "- However, **`1_precision` and `1_recall` have higher variation**, indicating models differ significantly in how well they handle the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Potential Improvements**\n",
    "- **Class Imbalance Handling:** The low recall and precision for class `1` suggest an imbalance. Try oversampling (SMOTE) or class-weighted training.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning Random Forest, SVM, or boosting models might improve results.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Better features could help improve separability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Model Choice**\n",
    "- If you prioritize **overall accuracy**, **Logistic Regression** is best.\n",
    "- If you need a **balanced model for both classes**, **CatBoost or SVM** might be the way to go.\n",
